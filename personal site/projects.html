                <h3>NYT Visual is an iOS experiment with one goal in mind: to engage with <b>Gen-Z</b> readers using a <strong>visual</strong>-first
                    landing page as a gateway into the news. 
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    In an age when most of my peers scroll through content and spend only a few seconds 
                    on an image unless it catches our interest, we believe the text-first news layout may be overwhelming 
                    and less engaging. I worked on frontend (Swift) and backend (Python)
                    alongside other interns and full-time employees during Maker Week, The Times's week-long summer hackathon. 
                    We then presented our prototype at a company-wide event.
